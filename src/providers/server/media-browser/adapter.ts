/**

 * concept, only a per-item IsFavorite flag. It still needs the same identity
 * contract as a real playlist (a stable `LocalId`, this server's
 * provenance) so the UI can't tell it apart from one that came off the wire
 * except by its id.
 */
/**
 * The adapter both MediaBrowser-derived servers share.
 *
 * Jellyfin and Emby differ only in the handful of details `MediaBrowserBrand`
 * captures, so there is one adapter parameterised by brand rather than two
 * files kept in step by hand. They were two files, identical but for the brand
 * constant and the client factory's name, and had already started to drift.
 *
 * A server whose API is genuinely different — Plex, say — gets its own
 * adapter. This is one protocol with two brands, not a place to put a third
 * protocol behind a flag.

     `PlayedItems` and the Stopped event do *different* things, and the app's
     suspicion that they double-count was checked against the server rather
     than reasoned about. They do not, on jellyfin 10.8.13 / 10.9.11 / 10.10.0:

      - `POST /Users/{id}/PlayedItems/{item}` runs `BaseItem.MarkPlayed`, which
        increments `PlayCount` only when a `datePlayed` is supplied. This call
        supplies none, so it clamps the count to at least one, sets `Played`,
        stamps `LastPlayedDate`, and stops.
      - The Stopped event never touches `PlayCount` at all; it runs
        `UpdatePlayState`, which decides the played flag and the resume point
        from the position.
      - The count itself is incremented by `/Sessions/Playing` — at position
        zero, when the track *starts*. That is where a Jellyfin play count
        comes from, for every client, and it is why a session of skipping
        raises play counts for tracks nobody listened to. It is the server's
        model, not something this adapter can fix by sending less.

     They also reach the scrobbler plugins by different routes, which is the
     part that matters most: `PlayedItems` raises `UserDataSaved` with reason
     `TogglePlayed`, and both the Last.fm and ListenBrainz plugins ignore that
     reason. Only the Stopped event scrobbles. So this call is what the
     Settings row promises — "mark as played on the server" — and nothing more.

  // idempotent Stopped so the local action goes cross-device without
  // waiting for the next real progress tick.
  //
  // Two things about this are worth someone's attention and are deliberately

  // was last touched for and each needs its own verification:
  //
  //  1. A Stopped is not free. The scrobbler plugins fire on it (see
  //     `reportPlaybackStop`), so a bookmark written on departure from a long
  //     track lands *alongside* the player's own Stopped for the same
  //     departure — two events, and potentially two scrobbles, for one listen.
  //     Bookmarks only apply to podcast episodes and tracks past twenty
  //     minutes, so this is narrow, but it is real.
  //  2. Jellyfin's `UpdatePlayState` forces the stored position to zero for
  //     any item that does not support position resume, and plain `Audio`
  //     inherits `false` for that — only `Video` overrides it. If that holds
  //     for `AudioBook` too, the server side of this mirror never stores
  //     anything for music and the local bookmark is doing all the work.
